Directions:
- index.html is the front page
- when editing or adding, leave a slightly descriptive commit that describes what you edited in that commit
- when editing or adding, leave a slightly descriptive comment that describes what you edited in that commit
  ex) if you wrote code in js to add a drop down menu, commit can say something like "added drop-down menu to student sign-in page".
